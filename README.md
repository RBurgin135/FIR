# FIR deep learning track racing

This was one of the projects I made over the first Covid lockdown, when I was 16. I made it using Pygame and assets I created myself using microsoft paint. It is exclusively coded in python. I created the deep learning components from scratch.

The program simulates racers driving around a given track. The track can be changed. Each racer has neural nets controlling their behaviour. Each racer can accelerate, brake, and turn. Their performance is assessed based on the number of 'progress lines' they hit as they progress around the track. The following generation are then cloned, with slight variations, from the best performing racer from the previous generations.
